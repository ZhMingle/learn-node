## modules - encapsulated code 封装好的代码

commonJS every file is module

```js
// Since module.exports is a object so you can do
module.exports = {} 
// and also
module.exports.a = 'a'

const obj = require('./')

// If require a file, the file's code will execute
```
// gatsby??


If you're comparing buying goods through blockchain versus traditional methods, here's how you could structure the comparison:

### Slide 1: **Title Slide**
- **Title:** Buying Goods Through Blockchain vs. Traditional Methods
- **Subtitle:** A Comparative Analysis
- **Your Name**
- **Date**

### Slide 2: **Introduction**
- **Purpose:** Understanding the differences between blockchain-based transactions and traditional purchasing methods.
- **Relevance:** Growing interest in blockchain technology as a secure and efficient alternative.

### Slide 3: **Overview of Traditional Purchasing Methods**
- **Intermediaries:** Banks, payment processors, credit card companies.
- **Process:** Involves multiple steps like placing an order, payment processing, and verification.
- **Time & Cost:** Typically involves transaction fees, processing time, and potential delays.

### Slide 4: **Overview of Blockchain-Based Purchasing**
- **Decentralization:** Transactions occur directly between buyer and seller with no intermediaries.
- **Process:** Use of cryptocurrencies or blockchain platforms to execute smart contracts.
- **Security & Transparency:** Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, offering increased security and transparency.




### Slide 6: **Advantages of Blockchain-Based Purchasing**
- **Cost Efficiency:** Lower fees due to the absence of intermediaries.
- **Speed:** Faster transactions, especially for cross-border payments.
- **Security:** Reduced risk of fraud and data breaches.
- **Transparency:** Clear and immutable records of all transactions.

### Slide 7: **Challenges with Blockchain Purchasing**
- **Adoption:** Limited merchant acceptance and consumer understanding.
- **Volatility:** Cryptocurrency price fluctuations can impact purchasing power.
- **Regulation:** Unclear legal status in many regions.
- **Technical Barriers:** Requires a basic understanding of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

### Slide 8: **Traditional Methods: Strengths & Weaknesses**
- **Strengths:**
  - Widely accepted and understood.
  - Established legal and regulatory frameworks.
  - Consumer protection mechanisms (chargebacks, dispute resolution).
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Higher costs due to fees.
  - Slower transactions, especially internationally.
  - Vulnerability to fraud and cyberattacks.

### Slide 9: **Case Study: Comparing a Purchase**
- **Traditional Method:** Example of buying goods online using a credit card.
  - Steps involved, time taken, costs incurred.
- **Blockchain Method:** Example of buying goods using cryptocurrency.
  - Steps involved, time taken, costs incurred.
- **Result:** Direct comparison of efficiency, cost, and security.

### Slide 10: **Conclusion**
- **Summary:** Blockchain offers significant advantages in terms of cost, speed, and security, but faces challenges in adoption and regulation.
- **Future Outlook:** As blockchain technology evolves, it may increasingly complement or even replace traditional methods for certain types of transactions.

### Slide 11: **Q&A**
- **Thank You!**
- Invite the audience to ask questions.
